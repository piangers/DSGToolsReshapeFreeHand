	DSGTools with the following features:
	-Creation, Storage and Deletion of PostGIS servers configurations
	-Database creation using Spatialite and PostGIS according to EDGV version 2.1.3 and EDGV version FTer_2a_Ed (cadaster)
	-Layer loading by category and class as defined by EDGV version 2.1.3 and EDGV version FTer_2a_Ed (cadaster)
	-Manipulation of complex features (Creation, Editing, Deletion, Zoom, Association, Disassociation) and
	-Access to some WM(T)S services provided by BDGEx.
	-Inventory Tool for all geospatial data supported by GDAL/OGR.
	-Tool to install Models and Script (geoalgorithms) in the Processing Toolbox (HSV fusion script available).
	-Database role management. Access profile (i.e. Read/Write permissions by table in database ).
	-Database user profile management (e.g. Grant/Revoke predifined roles to/from user ).
	-Create/Remove PostgreSQL users.
	-Alter PostgreSQL user Password.
	-Conversion tools between postgis and spatialite EDGV databases.
	-Tool to assign elevation values to contour lines in a simple way.
	-EDGV code list viewer to aid attributes queries using our EDGV databases.
	-Drop EDGV databases
	-Remove missing databases from qsettings
	-Tool to reclassify features (move them to another layer) with predefined attributes
	Requirements for LINUX (Ubuntu/Debian):
	Install the following packages as follows:
	sudo apt-get install python-qt4-sql
	sudo apt-get install libqt4-sql-psql
	sudo apt-get install libqt4-sql-sqlite
